GitHub API

<https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/>

Using 'GitHub CLI'

<https://github.com/cli/cli>

/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/GitHub\ CLI/gh.exe api repos/:owner/:repo/releases

This is paged somehow....

OR

/GitHub\ CLI/gh.exe api repos/:owner/:repo/releases/tags/rel-100

And increment up ?

The 'notes' are from the "body" key
