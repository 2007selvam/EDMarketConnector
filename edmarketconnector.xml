<h2>Release 3.44</h2>
<p><b>CHANGE OF MAINTAINER</b></p>
<p>Due to a lack of time to give the project the attention it needs Marginal has handed over ownership of the EDMarketConnector GitHub repository to the EDCD (Elite Dangerous Community Developers) organisation.</p>
<p>Initially Athanasius will now be responsible for maintaining the code, including addressing any Pull Requests and Issues, and making releases.  <b><u>Unfortunately he has no access to hardware running MacOS so can't easily generate builds for that platform</u> or test them.  So for the time being releases will be for Windows 10 only.</b>  MacOS users are advised to look into running from source (see the github README).</p>
<p>Going forwards the intention is to move to the python 3.7 code as soon as possible.  To facilitate this there will be one more python 2.7 release in addition to this one, with the main aim of that being to add code to alert the user about any plugins they use that have apparently not been updated to run under python 3.7.</p>
<p>See the project GitHub repository's <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> for further information.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Version increased to 3.4.4.0 / 3.44.</li>
 <li>URL the application checks for updates changed to point to github,</li>
</ul>

			<title>Release 4.1.6</title>

<h2>Release 4.1.6</h2>
<p>We might have finally found the cause of the application hangs during shutdown.
Note that this became easier to track down due to the downtime
for migration of <a href="http://www.edsm.net" rel="nofollow">www.edsm.net</a> around 2021-01-11.  Before these fixes EDSM's
API not being available would cause an EDMC hang on shutdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We've applied extra paranoia to some of the application shutdown code to
ensure we're not still trying to handle journal events during this sequence.</p>
<p>We also re-ordered the shutdown sequence, which might help avoid the shutdown
hang.</p>
<p>If you encounter a shutdown hang then please add a comment and log files to
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/678">Application can leave a zombie process on shutdown #678</a>
to help us track down the cause and fix it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now avoid making Tk event_generate() calls whilst the appliction is
shutting down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plugins should actively avoid making any sort of Tk event_generate() call
during application shutdown.</p>
<p>This means using <code>if not config.shutting_down:</code> to gate any code in worker
threads that might attempt this.  Also, be sure you're not attempting such
in your <code>plugin_stop()</code> function.</p>
<p>See plugins/edsm.py and plugins/inara.py for example of the usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any use of <code>plug.show_error()</code> won't actually change the UI status line
during shutdown, but the text you tried to show will be logged instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cargo tracking will now correctly count all instances of the same type of
cargo for different missions.  Previously it only counted the cargo for
the last mission requiring that cargo type, as found in Cargo.json.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loaded contents of Cargo.json can now be found in <code>monitor.state['CargoJSON']</code>.
<code>monitor.state</code> is what is passed to plugins as <code>state</code> in the
<code>journal_entry()</code> call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our logging code should now cope with logging from a property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging from any name-mangled method should now work properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miscellaneous updates to PLUGINS.md - mostly to clarify some things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
